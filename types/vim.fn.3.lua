-- 		{pat} matches.
--
-- 		A match at the first character or |List| item returns zero.
-- 		If there is no match -1 is returned.
--
-- 		For getting submatches see |matchlist()|.
-- 		Example: >
-- 			:echo match("testing", "ing")	" results in 4
-- 			:echo match([1, 'x'], '\a')	" results in 1
-- <		See |string-match| for how {pat} is used.

-- 		Vim doesn't have a strcasestr() function.  But you can add
-- 		"\c" to the pattern to ignore case: >
-- 			:let idx = match(haystack, '\cneedle')
-- <
-- 		If {start} is given, the search starts from byte index
-- 		{start} in a String or item {start} in a |List|.
-- 		The result, however, is still the index counted from the
-- 		first character/item.  Example: >
-- 			:echo match("testing", "ing", 2)
-- <		result is again "4". >
-- 			:echo match("testing", "ing", 4)
-- <		result is again "4". >
-- 			:echo match("testing", "t", 2)
-- <		result is "3".
-- 		For a String, if {start} > 0 then it is like the string starts
-- 		{start} bytes later, thus "^" will match at {start}.  Except
-- 		when {count} is given, then it's like matches before the
-- 		{start} byte are ignored (this is a bit complicated to keep it
-- 		backwards compatible).
-- 		For a String, if {start} < 0, it will be set to 0.  For a list
-- 		the index is counted from the end.
-- 		If {start} is out of range ({start} > strlen({expr}) for a
-- 		String or {start} > len({expr}) for a |List|) -1 is returned.
--
-- 		When {count} is given use the {count}'th match.  When a match
-- 		is found in a String the search for the next one starts one
-- 		character further.  Thus this example results in 1: >
-- 			echo match("testing", "..", 0, 2)
-- <		In a |List| the search continues in the next item.
-- 		Note that when {count} is added the way {start} works changes,
-- 		see above.
--
-- 		See |pattern| for the patterns that are accepted.
-- 		The 'ignorecase' option is used to set the ignore-caseness of
-- 		the pattern.  'smartcase' is NOT used.  The matching is always
-- 		done like 'magic' is set and 'cpoptions' is empty.

-- Call function {funcname} in the run-time library {libname}

-- 		This is useful to call functions in a library that you
-- 		especially made to be used with Vim.  Since only one argument
-- 		is possible, calling standard library functions is rather
-- 		limited.
-- 		The result is the String returned by the function.  If the
-- 		function returns NULL, this will appear as an empty string ""
-- 		to Vim.
-- 		If the function returns a number, use libcallnr()!
-- 		If {argument} is a number, it is passed to the function as an
-- 		int; if {argument} is a string, it is passed as a
-- 		null-terminated string.
-- 		This function will fail in |restricted-mode|.
--
-- 		libcall() allows you to write your own 'plug-in' extensions to
-- 		Vim without having to recompile the program.  It is NOT a
-- 		means to call system functions!  If you try to do so Vim will
-- 		very probably crash.
--
-- 		For Win32, the functions you write must be placed in a DLL
-- 		and use the normal C calling convention (NOT Pascal which is
-- 		used in Windows System DLLs).  The function must take exactly
-- 		one parameter, either a character pointer or a long integer,
-- 		and must return a character pointer or NULL.  The character
-- 		pointer returned must point to memory that will remain valid
-- 		after the function has returned (e.g. in static data in the
-- 		DLL).  If it points to allocated memory, that memory will
-- 		leak away.  Using a static buffer in the function should work,
-- 		it's then freed when the DLL is unloaded.
--
-- 		WARNING: If the function returns a non-valid pointer, Vim may
-- 		crash!	This also happens if the function returns a number,
-- 		because Vim thinks it's a pointer.
-- 		For Win32 systems, {libname} should be the filename of the DLL
-- 		without the ".DLL" suffix.  A full path is only required if
-- 		the DLL is not in the usual places.
-- 		For Unix: When compiling your own plugins, remember that the
-- 		object code must be compiled as position-independent ('PIC').

-- 				{nr} or {id}.  Only a |List| value is supported.
-- 		    nr		list number in the quickfix stack; zero
-- 				means the current quickfix list and "$" means
-- 				the last quickfix list
-- 		    title	quickfix list title text
-- 		Unsupported keys in {what} are ignored.
-- 		If the "nr" item is not present, then the current quickfix list
-- 		is modified. When creating a new quickfix list, "nr" can be
-- 		set to a value one greater than the quickfix stack size.
-- 		When modifying a quickfix list, to guarantee that the correct

--
-- 		{callback} is the function to call.  It can be the name of a

-- 		to turn a file name into a buffer number.
-- 		For setting the cursor and the ' mark "bufnum" is ignored,

-- 		Does not change the jumplist.
--
-- 		"lnum" and "col" are the position in the buffer.  The first
-- 		column is 1.  Use a zero "lnum" to delete a mark.  If "col" is
-- 		smaller than 1 then 1 is used.
--
-- 		The "off" number is only used when 'virtualedit' is set. Then
-- 		it is the offset in screen columns from the start of the

-- 		character.
--
-- 		The "curswant" number is only used when setting the cursor
-- 		position.  It sets the preferred column for when moving the
-- 		cursor vertically.  When the "curswant" number is missing the
-- 		preferred column is not set.  When it is present and setting a
-- 		mark position it is not used.
--

-- Show the {what} near the cursor, handle selecting one of the
-- 		items with cursorkeys, and close it an item is selected with
-- 		Space or Enter. {what} should have multiple lines to make this
-- 		useful.  This works like: >
-- 			call popup_create({what}, #{
-- 				\ pos: 'center',
-- 				\ zindex: 200,
-- 				\ drag: 1,
-- 				\ wrap: 0,
-- 				\ border: [],
-- 				\ cursorline: 1,
-- 				\ padding: [0,1,0,1],
-- 				\ filter: 'popup_filter_menu',
-- 				\ mapping: 0,
-- 				\ })
-- <		The current line is highlighted with a match using
-- 		"PopupSelected", or "PmenuSel" if that is not defined.
--
-- 		Use {options} to change the properties.  Should at least set
-- 		"callback" to a function that handles the selected item.
-- 		Example: >
-- 			func ColorSelected(id, result)
-- 			   " use a:result
-- 			endfunc
-- 			call popup_menu(['red', 'green', 'blue'], #{
-- 				\ callback: 'ColorSelected',

-- 		Also see |term_setansicolors()| and |g:terminal_ansi_colors|.
-- 		If neither was used returns the default colors.
--
-- 		{buf} is used as with |term_getsize()|.  If the buffer does not
-- 		exist or is not a terminal window, an empty list is returned.

-- {feature} argument is a feature name like "nvim-0.2.1" or

--
-- 		Vim's compile-time feature-names (prefixed with "+") are not
-- 		recognized because Nvim is always compiled with all possible
-- 		features. |feature-compile|
--
-- 		Feature names can be:
-- 		1.  Nvim version. For example the "nvim-0.2.1" feature means
-- 		    that Nvim is version 0.2.1 or later: >
-- 			:if has("nvim-0.2.1")
--
-- <		2.  Runtime condition or other pseudo-feature. For example the
-- 		    "win32" feature checks if the current system is Windows: >
-- 			:if has("win32")
-- <							*feature-list*
-- 		    List of supported pseudo-feature names:
-- 		        acl		|ACL| support
-- 			bsd		BSD system (not macOS, use "mac" for that).
-- 		        iconv		Can use |iconv()| for conversion.
-- 		        +shellslash	Can use backslashes in filenames (Windows)
-- 			clipboard	|clipboard| provider is available.
-- 			mac		MacOS system.
-- 			nvim		This is Nvim.
-- 			python2		Legacy Vim |python2| interface. |has-python|
-- 			python3		Legacy Vim |python3| interface. |has-python|
-- 			pythonx		Legacy Vim |python_x| interface. |has-pythonx|
-- 			ttyin		input is a terminal (tty)
-- 			ttyout		output is a terminal (tty)
-- 			unix		Unix system.
-- 			*vim_starting*	True during |startup|.
-- 			win32		Windows system (32 or 64 bit).
-- 			win64		Windows system (64 bit).
-- 			wsl		WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) system
--
-- 							*has-patch*
-- 		3.  Vim patch. For example the "patch123" feature means that
-- 		    Vim patch 123 at the current |v:version| was included: >
-- 			:if v:version > 602 || v:version == 602 && has("patch148")
--
-- <		4.  Vim version. For example the "patch-7.4.237" feature means
-- 		    that Nvim is Vim-compatible to version 7.4.237 or later. >
-- 			:if has("patch-7.4.237")

-- Put up a directory requester.  This only works when
-- 		"has("browse")" returns |TRUE| (only in some GUI versions).
-- 		On systems where a directory browser is not supported a file
-- 		browser is used.  In that case: select a file in the directory
-- 		to be used.
-- 		The input fields are:
-- 		    {title}	title for the requester
-- 		    {initdir}	directory to start browsing in
-- 		When the "Cancel" button is hit, something went wrong, or
-- 		browsing is not possible, an empty string is returned.
